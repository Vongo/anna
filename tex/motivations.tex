\section{Motivations}
We first chose this course in order to discover a new programming language (Python) as well as a new domain of IT : Natural Language Processing.\\
NLP is an important IT domain nowadays. More and more NLP-based applications are developed and there are many different use cases. The simplest one is in our pocket since every smartphone now supports predictive text, Apple's SIRI and Android's \say{Ok Google} understand pretty much everything the user is saying and handwriting recognition is also a thing. All of this is provided by technologies based on NLP and we can safely say that, in our multilingual society, these technologies will soon be a must-have.\\
Regarding our project's topic, we all are movies aficionados and the idea of interacting with a bot using our favorite movies' punchlines was very tempting. This is also the occasion to learn more about the english language (grammatically and syntactically speaking) which isn't our mother tongue.
