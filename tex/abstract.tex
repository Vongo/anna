\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Abstract}
This project is done in the context of our semester at the University of Passau which is part of our double master degree INSA Lyon Informatique (INSA IF) - Uni Passau Information und Kommunikation (IFIK).
The goal here is to make use of what we learned in the seven first weeks of the \textit{Text Mining Project} course.\\
Our idea is to exploit movies' scripts in order to create a bot which you can speak with. This bot is called Anna in reference to the Basshunter's song Boten Anna\footnote{Boten Anna on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYQUsp-jxDQ}. \\
This report will be organized as follows. First we will describe our motivations, then present the chosen dataset as well as some enrichments and statistics and finally we will describe how our solution works.
