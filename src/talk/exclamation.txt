Lower your weapon. I told you - lower your weapon!
Don't. Don't let him surrender. Shoot him!
Shut up!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot him!!
No on shoot! No one shoot!! No officer will follow. No officer will shoot!
Shut up!
Shoot! Shoot him!!
Let her go! Let her go!!
Tell him to put his gun down!
Holster your weapons! Back away. That is an order! No officers will fire!
No one shoot! Lower your weapons! Do not fire! No officer will fire his weapon unless I say so!  Let the woman go!
Let her go. Let her fucking go!!
I'll kill her! Back off! Everyone back away from me!
Drop the gun! DON'T SHOOT!
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
Traitor!!
He knew exactly what he was doing - all of this was planned! It's all here in my movie. Emil is not insane. Look. Look!
I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane! Hard to believe...watch!
Wait a minute, Bruce! We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at!
Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!
...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill!
Hello?  No!
They've got her testimony on videotape. And even if they do take her to court immediately after she'll be extradited. The Czechs want her back. She shot a cop! I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic? How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!
But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
Shit!
Everybody down! Stay DOWN!
Look! Over here!
Shoot him! SHOOT!
Kill him! Kill the bastard!
Hey, come back here!
Drop the girl! Drop her!!
Don't move!
Look at that. See that shot! Seamless. No cuts.  And look. Look at that transition. That's filmmaking!! Isn't it great?!
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!
Don't stoop to his level!
Where are you goin'?? This ain't the way to the station!
What are you doin'? You're gonna lose everybody!
Alright, let's get going!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Don't say a word. Don't respond to his taunting!  He's represented by counsel. You want to speak to someone - you speak to me!
Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes. I'll follow you. Tommy, you ride with him!
Well, he killed my partner!
He's my collar!
We're takin' him. Don't argue!
No way! He's mine!
Turn that camera off!
Yes. Yes, come with me!
Turn that camera off!
I give up!
Don't move! Don't move! Get your hands up! Drop it!
He has the camera! He took the movie!
Oh no! No! Shit!
No, I don't get that!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Shut up. Look!
Oleg, don't be paranoid. You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you? I gave you half of what they gave me. Look - here we are!
America! Who says you can't be success in America? I arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look - I am a success story!
You want the tape? There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
I want your shield number!
Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV, I'll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it'll come outta your mouth!
He's not on the premises!
Where is he?! Where is Hawkins?!
They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment!
Get outta here!
I did this! I did this! Take my picture! I'm Max! Max Gornick!
Isn't she a beauty? She's my fire, look at that loom-up on her!
Are you alright, man? Lemme see the hand!
Jordy! What the hell happened?!
It's okay. I'm a fireman. I'm going to help you. Get back! Now!
The hallway is on fire!
Get back! Get out of the bathroom! Run!
And this is the man who started the fire. Say something to your fans, Emil!
Oh shit!
Pouring it out!
Oh Jesus!
Calm down. Get a hold of yourself! Get down!
They were here!
Oh my G-d! Oh my G-d!
Don't! It'll suck the flames toward us!
No! Get back! GET BACK!!!
Jordy!!!
Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
And...action!
Cut!
Okay. He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Good idea!
No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous!
Nicky?!
Coming!
Oh really. That's nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here. I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!! I beep you - you don't return my call. Where the hell have you been?!
Sit down!
What does it look like? It's an address book!
Shit!
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
Perfect! Cut. Print!
Emil, look!
Split up!
Put the fuckin' camera down! Let's go!
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
C'mon in. C'mon in!
You! I've seen you on TV!
This is second day in America. First day was very exciting. Full of thrills and chills. Over there, is co-star of my new movie, Emil!
Alright, alright - don't hurt me!
Give me the address!!
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Get in the bathroom!
Max!
It's my fire! Screw homicide. I'll tell you guys everything!
Who do you think, Chief?!
What the hell is that?? You gave Eddie Flemming the evidence?!
I take her. Send her!
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
You said speak Czech!
Speak English!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer. Emil grabs the videocamera.  Don't break it! Don't break it!
Turn that fucking thing off!
A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights!
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no!
Don't blow your nose!
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
Yo, Jordy!
Wait! Come back!!
Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like this. Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Nice - how many people you ripped off tonight?! Get up!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
She saw!
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
As a plumber?!
Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
We spent it!
Milos. Get my money!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look. It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?! I wasn't going to wait!!!
Surprise! Surprise!
Emil???!
Go!
Don't speak Russian!
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
This one is from Mendez!
God bless you, and those like you!
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much. I still can't accept the world as it is!
Captain Mendez!
Your brother was right. I should have never taken you with me. I'll never forgive myself. Never!
Here is Europe... and over here, the continent of Asia. But there's something in between! Another continent! We've found... another continent!
Tierra...! Tierra!
God, how much I've missed you!
No matter how long you live, Sanchez, there's something that will never change between us. I did it! You didn't!
Penitent...? He is suing us for breach of contract!
In your present state it is madness, Father!
This time with me!
Good! I have to go back!
Utapan!
Nobody wants one...! Only you!
You are nothing! You bastards will never inherit your titles. We are everything. We are immortal!
You did the same to your God!
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
Moxica is right. Our ways don't work!
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Tell them I want them to watch this!
Tell him to put his hands on the table. Like this!
Bring him here!
He's lying!
He says he has not found any!
God forgive us!
We've got to learn to live like the Indians.  Eat your Iguana!
What wrong with it? The Indians eat it!
She's more than that!
Nima's a good cook!
To the new world, my friend! To the new world!
To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten!
These animals should be shown what savagery can be!
He's growing up!
The royal surgeon? Then we can count on royal health!
You might have given us a choice!
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
Si! Si! Muy bien! Excellente!
Damn you!
Now go!
We may have to cut it!
Stay with me!
Get below! All of you! Go!
You come! You speak first!
Utapan! Wait!
Do something! Help him!
Help him!
Say not here! Cuba!
Cuba! Cuba!
Give it to him!
Gold...! Gold!
Colon!
Arquebuses!
Mendez! Mendez!
God doesn't want us to cross the ocean...! This voyage is cursed!
You tell that to them!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
The land is there. I know it!
We're lost!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You must be mad...!
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Continue rowing!
Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir!
Six hundred and twenty nine!
Mark. Twenty nine, Sir!
To your post! At once!
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
Shit!
Chicken-ass face!
Don't move! A mistake of one degree and we'll be off 6,000 leagues!
What is it Mendez? Speak!
Take care of my investment, wherever you're going!
Diego! Here!
Give me absolution, Father!
May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I want to go with you!
There aren't any monsters, Fernando. The only monsters are in here...  Watch!
You can't go there!
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
If you can do that, Excellency -- I'll become a monk!
I'm not bargaining!
NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
If I am right, my requests are fair!
Underdone! It's monstrous, Excellency!
The highest titles of nobility, Your Excellency! To an immigrant sheltered by monks!
Go on!
Actually, I thought you were younger than me!
Then we are equal... since you are the only sailor I know!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Rise...! Come forward!
These people built Granada... Centuries ago! It is a great victory over the Moors, Don Colon -- and yet what a tragedy it is!
Jesus! Just my luck!
Colon! Don't!
All of them! Just lies!
No...! My books...!
These don't mean anything! They're full of assumptions! Out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens!
Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Colon!
Damn God!
They didn't listen. They didn't want to listen!
The Judgment is ours!
And Colon -- the one who populates!
Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the Bearer of the Cross!
Your life, and that of others!
We wouldn't have to turn back! We would find land at this point!
How would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water? Water is undrinkable after six weeks! You'd never be able to turn back!
Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers. Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a year!
But you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken!
I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
Fernando!
Fernando!
Look, Father!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Passion is something one cannot control!
Father Marchena!
So was Christ!
God... That's in a week!
Diego!
Get your hands off her!
Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!
It's empty!
Oh, my God!
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call. I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in. You remember that?  Here, take it, man! You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
Me? Are you kiddin? You're the one! You were a hero, man. They gave you a pardon! And whadda you do? You come back and fuck with your teeth! Wow!
I'm staying here! You got that? You can't stop me!
This is the present. This is not the past. This is not the future. This is right now!
I've done my job. I did what you wanted. Good luck. I'm not coming back!
Listen, I don't know whether you're there or not. Maybe you just clean carpets. If you do, you're lucky -- you're gonna live a long, happy life. But if you other guys exist and you're picking this up -- forget about the Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they didn't do it. It was a mistake' Someone else did it. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids playing revolutionaries. It was someone else!
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
That's what they were up to! Freeing animals!
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
Let's do it!
James! James! It's okay. We're insane! We're crazy!
Wait here. I'm going to try that phone number. Let's hope it's nothing!
James, no!
This is my territory, bitch!
An hour?!
You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
James, come on! We have to get out of here!
James -- put your hands down and listen to me. Things have changed!
James!
Kathryn!
You! I know you!
That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
A full pardon!
We're very close! Because of you!
Superior work! Superior!
Stress! Time travel!
During your "interview," while you were..."under the influence," you told us you liked music!
Well done, James! Well done! Nice going! Congratulations! Good for you!
What? What's that? What did he say? His brain's fried. Give him another shot!
Come on, Cole, cooperate!
Wake up! Wake up!
It's a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation.  He's sick. He thinks he comes from the future. He's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate. He needs help!
I'd like to be clear about this. That man and the other one were..."severely" beating us. James Cole didn't start it. In fact -- he saved me!
No, sir!
Definitely a mistake!
July?!
So if you want to watch a particular program, say "All My Children" or something, you go to the Charge Nurse and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on. But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on. There was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played. He couldn't quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't just make it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!!
Seriously, more and more people are being defined now as mentally ill. Why? Because they're not consuming on their own. But as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care. And this gives the so-called sane people work!
Don't mock me, my friend.  It's a condition of "mental divergence". I find myself on another planet, Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though it's a totally convincing reality in every way...I can feel, breathe, hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend? The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE. P.A. SYSTEM  James Cole. Report to Staff. James Cole!
Staff! Whoo! Time for Staff. Now the geniuses cure you. Hallelujah!
This is a place for crazy people! I'm not crazy!
No! I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the phone. One call!
Germs?!
In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
They hurt you!
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
Get it? Monk - Key. Monk!  Key!
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up -- try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan!
Not, "what", babe! When!
He was fully sedated!
You were in a mental institution?!
You were sent to make very important observations!
It was supposed to be 1995. RASPY VOICE  Science isn't an exact science with these clowns. You're lucky you didn't end up in ancient Egypt!
Captain! A Kraut! We got a Kraut!
Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very important!
Get in!
But that's... that's more than 200 miles!
I've never seen the ocean!
Can you...can you make it louder? I love hearing twentieth century music! Hearing music and breathing air!
It's just as I told you -- my husband and I had gone ahead -- she never showed. That's totally unlike her!
Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that cat's starving! She would never neglect her cat!
No! Don't leave me here like this!
Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left!
The Twelve Monkeys!!! They're here.  Somewhere. Come on!
Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.  They hear everything. They got that tracking device on you. They can find you anywhere. Anytime. Ha Ha!
Please! Please don't hurt me!
Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
Lock it now!
Shut up!
Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out!
No -- he said his father was "God"!
You're making that up!
These people -- all of 'em -- are true weirdoes!
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future!
Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
You're right! Absolutely right. Me's a nut case, totally deranged. Delusional!
Maybe he's not driving!
See -- you can drive after all!
Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
No gun!  Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
I love this world!
