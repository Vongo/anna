Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you saw it.
Get a shot of him leaving. Then pan to me.
Cut.
No thanks.
Wait a minute. Where are you going? Learn from Eddie. Talk to the court of public opinion. Take the credit, you need it.
A film...by Oleg Razgul.
He's still alive.
I'm not a cop. I'm a fire marshal.
I told you not to shoot! No officers should shoot.
Let her go. Let her go.
I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he lowers his gun.
Let her go.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Be careful. I can kill you. I'm insane.
You may not like it marshal, but that's the law.
Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions.
...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future.
Whatever's leftover, keep.
I can't believe this guy got off. Unbelievable.
That's right, I encountered him right here. I was just askin' for change an' he whips out his big gun an' pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin' me there all exposed...
Hello?  No comment.
Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct descendent of the African King from whom he takes his name...
She starts over.
Goddamn assholes everywhere. Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba. I got it. I'll do it. Shit. Let's start again.
Zwangendaba.
...and today with his partner who he blamed for the crimes still at large, Emil Slovak will appear in court. His lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial. Eyewitness News has also learned that later this month, Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing in court. He will be arraigned on charges of violating the civil rights of...Zwangen...Zwagen...
Shhhh.
Daphne, I...
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
We're gonna fight the extradition.
You want to see her - go ahead.
And just between us...I was married to a redhead. They're a jinx. Redheads are like cross-eyed priests. Stay away from both. Jordy gives him a look.
Look, what don't you understand? We've got a good relationship with the Czech's and the State Department doesn't want to cause an incident.
I know you got backup at home. Drop it off.
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Oh, Jesus.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Give me another one, please.
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no.
But it's...
No. No way.
I would say...half. Half is fair.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
No, he is here. Shit...
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
I was all of these.
...delusions and paranoia.
I want you to focus on three things: fear...
How're they treating you, alright  I want to get the cuffs off... but there's a little bit of a problem. Things out there are very negative right now for us. We gotta change that around. Perception is very, very important. Perception is reality. I know you're not fuckin' crazy. But it's important that I get that message out. Cause that's our only defense in this case.
Oh, sure.
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. What's happened is not his fault. Emil was under the influence of his partner. At the trial, you'll see that my client will be vindicated...
In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was not the alleged mastermind behind the murders. According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was being directed by his partner, who threatened to kill him if he didn't follow Mr. Razgul's orders. Cutler told reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in fact stab his client.
In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims his client is unfit to stand trial.
...and the wild chase through Times Square ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping. The fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.
Middle door.
Come in.
R-room service.
Keep your mouth shut. Don't mess this up.
Gimme your gun, Jordy. We all want him dead but you can't do it this way.
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Get down on your knees.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
You'll be my first.
You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Pull the gun! You want to be famous? Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and make more money.
You wanna be a real American? Go for your gun.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Tommy, take a walk.
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Jordy...??? Listen to me. You can't do this. This isn't the way to do things.
Don't get into it on TV.
Don't give me that fucking shit.
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Don't you put your hands on me, Detective.
Out of the way, counselor.
You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are goin' down. I'll be there with a smile when they put you down! Cutler hurries to Emil's side.
He's yours but I take him in! I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
I'll take him.
I'm coming with you.
Don't say anything.
No. Keep filming...
This man is unarmed, officer. He's surrendered.
Here. I have your money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil. I'm insane.
Oh, hello.
You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you.
Yes. But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.
Your idea? I thought it was my idea.
Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Die. Die.
Be quiet. Watch.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
I'm serious.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Good evening. Welcome to "Top Story". Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television. And I do so with a heavy heart. You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming. It would be only normal to ask, why? Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it. A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom. Eddie Flemming was my friend. I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward. Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. The restaurant BUZZES. Emil checks his watch.
What we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage...
Any request for the video must be directed to "Top Story's" attorney - Bruce Cutler. I'll be happy to give you his number.
I want the tape. Go get it and bring it here this minute.
This is great film! You can see fire right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire Marshal is here. Everything is so messy. Everything is so crazy right here! Look at this fire! We made it! 90% of people who die in fire die from eating smoke. So most likely they all die from eating smoke.
This is Jordan Warsaw! We got a 1075, make it quick, we're trapped! 8th Avenue and 44th Street.
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Right.
You better get packed.
Let's get your stuff.
I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
I'm sorry.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
The mugger.
Consider yourself served.
Yeah.
Okay. But not water sports.
Yeah.
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Not good.
Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it.
What? It doesn't work that way.
We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call. Robert steps off the stool. Takes the phone.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You've got a call.
I'd never had a great relationship before. I'd never made great choices with men. And he wasn't easy to get to know. He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved with him. But he was so great to me. Always encouraging, telling me I could do anything...  He was the one. You know, I'd give up everything - everything - for just a little more time. I would've spent fifteen minutes with him if that's all I knew I had. She's lost it. Hawkins consoles her. Nicolette shrugs him off - turns back to her drink. Downs the rest of it. A
That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Alright. Go ahead.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
Well, he...
I know.
You know...you know he was gonna propose to me. The crime guys found a card he'd written out to me. And a ring box...these fuckers that killed him - have my ring. They have my diamond engagement ring... Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.
I know, son, I know. We all loved him.
I never got to tell him how much I admired him.
Awful...what an awful day. He was New York City.
Bad last moment - I cut that out.
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action!'
Turn it off.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Then do it, asshole.
I kill someone famous.
What's your accomplishment.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
I'll call you later.
It's Flemming...anything turn up? Did they check the hospitals? Airports? Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin' hit him! We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything! These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...
You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it. Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Wait.
Eddie, I...
Will do, Chief.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
It was my decision, not his.
Oh.
There was too much press hangin' around there. I didn't want her face on the news. So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down.
This way, ma'am.
Tommy, get her outta here.
I told him to take her there.
No! Nothing happened.
I let her take a shower.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Hey. Warsaw.
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Let me get a shot of it.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
I did.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
You can trust me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone... He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I know.
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.
You could shower with me.
Showers are this way.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
No.
No.
Yes, I considered it.
Yeah. This way.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Don't be late.
Thank you.
See you later. Good luck.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah. I promise.
Tonight.
Okay, til tonight.
I love you.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.
Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.
That's good.
What? Oh. Okay. Yeah.
Katie. We don't know where she is. We can't find her. You gotta anchor the 5:00. This is your shot. Come now.
We need you here in twenty minutes. Get in a cab.
Answer it.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.
You know, Nicky, I've been married twice before. My first wife was a professional woman, didn't have time for children. My second wife...I never wanted to go home to her.
You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet.
Could be Leon's.
C'mere.
You're not so bad yourself.
You're ruthless.
You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something.
I'm not.
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
Stop it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something.
What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
Hey.
Hey, honey.
She's here.
I want to live the rest of my life with you...I don't know you've been married before and I've never been married, but I do love you, and...
I want to talk to you about something serious.
Staring right at us.
I can't take you to my place.
Divorced.
They won't until this is over.
I will if they don't send me back.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
This is nothing.
Shut up.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.
Hey. I'm a professional.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
You know what I'm saying here.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
Raw deal.
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
Yes, but he was a cop.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
Go on.
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
No. I'm okay.
of the scene from across the corner.
Stay with her.
The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
I don't want to kill you. But if you talk, I will.  I thought you'd want these.
Smart girl. I'm glad you're not a whore. But washing hair? This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They should be washing your hair.
In a minute, Ludwig.
I'm not a killer.
When I lose it, I lose control. I didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole from me. Cheated me! When I went to prison, they beat me. I still didn't tell he was my partner. I loved Milos like a brother... The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
I...I have a temper.
Well, then do it after work. A customer's waiting.
Why are you messing with your hair color again? You're going to kill your hair. You won't look good with black hair.
Daphne? In the back. Probably shampooing a customer's hair.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first. Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Of course.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm on duty.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Describe him.
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
Beautiful eyes.
Yeah. Sort of. I tried to recruit her, gave her my card. She said she'd think about it but I never heard from her.
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
No.
Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl...
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Just a minute. Shit. And I don't have a camera. Hold on a second.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Better than one.
Two heads.
Oh here. A souvenir.
Heads. See, you lost twice.  Okay. Get in.
Okay. I'll call it. Heads.
I'll call it... tails. Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll let you know what happens.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Good work.
Call communications and get an address on that number.
Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.
There was only one call from this room last night. I dialed it. It's an escort service.
I think we've already found it.
Could be. Then we should find it here somewhere.
If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks aren't deep but they're kinda wide... not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.
Yeah.
Do the seat for me.
Clothes were off in the other room. Tub is dry except for the blood.
I'll do it.
Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
After you.
Tommy Cullen. Heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you. Here's what we got. A girl in there, figure her to be a prostitute, looks like she was fighting for her life. She's got defense wounds on her hands. Right this way - in the bathroom.
It's okay.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case. Jordy enters. Leon steps in his way.
Takin' a bath.
Thank you, son.
Let me help.
Get a taxi.
And these.
Yes. Both.
In here, says he wants a million.
New York's finest. This is his case.
Stay here.
My folks are.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
This isn't homicide school.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll come with you.
Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh. Really? Okay.  We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue. A stabbing. Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian...
Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Hmmmm.
Pretty.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Good. Good. Commendable.
I don't even watch TV.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, I musta missed it.
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
She keepin' you up? Like to meet her, huh? She'd make you forget your ex wife. Cure your insomnia.
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go see him in the morning.
I got the owner of the plumbing company Milos worked for.
Well, they're definitely permanent residents now.
Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone - they've been here illegally.
-- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don't know who your girl is.
I gotta good look at her.
Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge. Big, blue eyes and when I saw her, she looked scared. Like she was looking to get away. But she was absolutely beautiful.
Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address and then you go.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Hi, I'm Honey.
I love America. No one is responsible for what they do.
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I wasn't convicted. Emil leans forward - listening. Fascinated.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Look, I'm a victim here, too. I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate. My life has been permanently disrupted.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Louder.
Louder.
Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now, Mr. Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim. According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to believe...watch.
Okay. Okay. We'll ban him from the station.
He's no joke! One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big.
He hangs around downstairs. The guys talk to him. He's a joke...
Get in line.
That's it. I'm suing.
That's it! You're outta here.
Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a big shot downtown.
Max.
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I used an accelerant.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Hey guys, I got your torch. He just gave a full confession.
You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Yeah, right.
Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech girl.
Losin' my job and everything, caused my behavioral disorder.  Forgive me, Kirk. Let me hug you? The audience boos. Roseanne mediates...
I take full responsibility for sleepin' with my daughter in law. I had low self esteem, I thought I had to compete with him.
Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this. Now get outta here.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
You motherfuckin' bastard! She stripped me! It was a bag lady! She touched me all over, it was disgusting.
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
There are two bodies found at this point.
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
He knew all along.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
Here you go. A big double homicide.
A timer.
They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident.
No problem.
Evidence. Of a homicide.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.
That's what it looks like to me.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
Mouth's clean, too.
Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
No. Go ahead.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do.
Sorry, bro.
Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe. Looks like they got careless.
Oh, sure.
Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents.
Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
I don't know. We got the experts here. Show them what you found - I hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.
Homicide? Who let them up? I didn't make it a crime scene yet.
Yeah, I radioed you guys right away 'cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you don't hafta investigate cause homicide is up there.
Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor.
I'll send a cop back for you.
Oh yeah? Guess again.
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.
Six month visa. Still here two years later. They'll deport her if she goes to Police.
Daphne Hanlova.
We started over, you can too.
It's easy to learn.
Yes, the money is good.
I can get you a job.
Emil. I'll help you.
Emil. Put down the knife.
Ha. Ha.
Hello, Tamina.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
There. 5RW.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I know you man.
Well, sounds like burglary to me.
It's not my house, man. I don't live here.
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Keep them out of my way.
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
Yeah. I make big cases, they make the news and I look good. But the problem with becoming a star is downtown. They shoot at stars. Now be quiet. Shhh.
Top floor. Back room.
Yeah. And he still went to the party. Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.
That's unique.
He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Not what. Who.
Here.
We have no money. Come on.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
The thrill of the hunt. I love it.
Tomorrow. At lunch.
I'm gonna propose.
Dog food.
You stuff sausage in it.
I am butcher.
Step into my office.
Paulie, I need the cure.
Sure it's him? Great!  Unique's home.
My kids don't talk to me anymore but they were great when they were young.
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
I'm not moody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later. That's me.
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
Vodka tonic.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Another martini.
Jesus Christ.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Look how long the line is. We gotta move 'em out. I'll take them down to secondary.
Well, they've got valid visas, but they don't have much money. Uh... and I'm not...uh, I think there's a possibility they may be coming to live and reside.
He made joke, bad joke. First time on airplane...
Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
I'm here for movies.
A cheap hotel.
New York.
I speak English.
He doesn't speak English.
Two weeks.
We are both from Prague.
Yes...he's my friend.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Yes.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Two weeks holiday.
Yes sir.
I want to document my trip to America.
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
I remember...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
Fine, it seems. Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo... He says he received many letters for you. Some of your men, mostly.
It's Diego... He is at the Court, with Santangel... He says they hope to get your privileges restored... And maybe the house.
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing. FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.
I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
What is it, now? Tell me...
I am busy inside.
New worlds create new people.
I knew you would.
I have to disagree.
More than ever I wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens... The world changes -- and yet it seems the same. We find new worlds, but fill them with the same people...
Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens.
Yes. I forgave you a long time ago. You see, I was proud of you. You were like a willful child. You wouldn't accept what others told you. You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself -- and others -- in the process.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I suppose we're both old men now.
A waste...? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You can see for yourself.
My God...! I thought he was dead.
His name... Amerigo Vespucci...
... This continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your Majesty...
Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace -- has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent... Tierra Incognita...
... West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo. From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael... Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios...
The sunset route to the new
I... I have to see Mendez.
Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de Dios...  But as he vomits and cries, he notices:
Oh my God...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Father...
I don't understand.
No. Says those are lakes. Water on other side big -- as wide as here.
Ask him if he means a lake. A big lake.
He says -- water on the other side.
Tell me what he's saying.
We can't be.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
The mainland...
Swallow a piece of pork fat on a string. It always worked.
Not bad.
Steady as she goes...
West... southwest, Captain Mendez...
I wish you could have compromised. It would have made your life easier...
What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a discoverer, a man of imagination... not a politician. You weren't meant to govern -- You cannot be all things to all men.
On the contrary. It is I who owe you everything. Through you, I have been an adventurer, an explorer! It's true I shall never see the new world... but it's here...  And here...
I owe you everything, Santangel...
Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
They took everything...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
All of them created by people like me.
Roofs... towers, palaces...
Look out of that window.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Call them.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Because he is not afraid of me.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.
Thank you.
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world...
Now I do look older than you.
Rise... Please...
In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.  I beg Your Majesty to receive him. To hear him... He will make no more demands. He has changed. He is penitent.
It does not belong to him.
All he asks is a chance to explore this... mainland.
Granted his faults. Yes, a hundred times! But the man is still remarkable.
I am happy for you, Diego.
She's very beautiful! The Queen has very good taste. Diego is getting married.
I can't go anyway.
Nobody is forcing you to come with us.
I have to explore the mainland.
Santangel is going to see the Queen.
Fernando...! My God...! He laughs, overcome with joy. Embraces DIEGO.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.
Didn't you learn? The mainland was discovered. Weeks ago. By another Italian. I forgot his name.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
My letters of appointment.
Yes... I remember...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
He must be replaced.
Yes, Your Majesty. It is all true. I saw it with my own eyes.
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
You never learned how to speak my language.
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
This is not how I imagined it to be.
Perhaps hope only exists in the journey. When it begins, everything is still possible -- every expectation; every dream...
A new world, Brother Buyl.
You may do as you please, Brother Buyl -- though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly.
I wish to go back with them, Don Colon. I have no desire to remain in this godless place.
We have to stop this war.
You will regret this.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Don't Moxica! You can't...
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time.
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
No, Your Majesty. They go mad -- then they die. There is nothing we can do.
It seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women, Your Majesty.
I don't know. It seems almost as if we have exchanged diseases with the Indians. They die of our most common cold, and we of their plague.
Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.
Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination.
Not enough to justify a single shipment.
Nothing grows here! Everything rots in the ground. The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them.
He wishes he were back in the seminary. Priests always eat well.  And they have very good cellars.
I'm not an Indian.
Iguana.
I'd like to know what I'm eating.
Eat! I'll tell you later.
Thank you, Don Moxica.
Forgive me, Don Moxica. But it was your horse I was talking about.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
My horse doesn't work.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we need your horse.
Ask him if he will help.
He understands.
No...! you'll do it my way.  Tell the Chief we will not harm his people, even though we have the power to do it.
We should kill them, Don Colon.
The monkey is lying.
God have mercy on their souls...
Another tribe made war on them...
They here.
We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We don't need to know.
Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty nine brave men who trusted me.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
No Guevara. There will be no revenge.
No mercy! Let's find them.
Three heads for every life taken.
It is a great honor. We could not hope for anything better.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
You don't usually ask.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a hundred farmers, twenty miners... and Doctor Chanca, the royal surgeon.
Admiral! The horses have arrived.
Now -- you tell me. Who can I trust?  We're brothers! We must be a House. A bloodline! In this country one can't exist alone! I need you...! Both of you! He walks then to the balustrade. The cries from the courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants begin to look up, aware of his presence.
Of course... Of course... We'll see to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon... Soon...
Let me show you something.
You bastard... you always had your own way...
You know I never shared those dreams with you.
I need both of you. What are you afraid of? We are living what we always dreamt of.
Bartolome is stronger, more capable than I will ever be...
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
I see I was mistaken. Don Colon has no need for my services... And he walks off. SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of ham.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
I trust they are men of quality.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Don Colon -- Don Alonso de Bobadilla. A man who knows our laws.
To your second expedition.
You defend yourself admirably...
These are gifts for Your Majesty.
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You must not inhale, but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavor of the Tobacco...
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
One... two... three... four... five...
One... two... three... four...
I said -- below deck, Mendez! MENDEZ crawls away.
That's a beginning...
Chief says he knows you like his...  Women...
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
Chief says...
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says -- he has a God.
To bring the word of God.
Thousands.
Tell him we will return very soon. Many of us.
Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief knows.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb! I'd sell my soul for it.  Help me up. I've got to piss, gold.
Well... You'll have to continue without me...
He dead.
Island. Far.
In the name of their Gracious Majesties of Castille and Aragon, and by all the powers vested in me, I claim this island and name it San Salvador. The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand, flapping in the wind. COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence the rest follow.
By the... by the Grace of... God...
Land...
You lucky bastard...
Alonso! Jaime! Don't let this wind escape us.
You start first.
This jacket to the first man who sights land! I want a man up that mast day and night.
Listen to me! Every man is afraid who does something for the first time. But those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards. I do not know if it is God's will that we cross this ocean -- but I am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts...
This boy has the voice of an angel. What comes out of his mouth is blessed, Alonso. What comes out of your is evil.
We set sail for greed. God has abandoned us. The voyage is cursed. There are signs...
You're right. Let the men decide.
You bloody...
Six days ago, yes.
Granted.
Captain Pinzon requests permission to board.
I think I do.
Captain, I don't understand.
I heard.
Six hundred and twenty nine.
And why does this one take to the sea? Nobody knows. Never says a word...
Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso.
We should have seen land.
Culo de galina es el hijo del demonio...
We'll all go crazy...
He's the devil's child...
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
That's it. The twenty eighth parallel. And we'll follow it until we reach land.
Twenty eight.
Come over here.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
God be with us admiral.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
Vaya con Dios!  They wave back.
I have to tell you Santangel. I don't know where on earth I am going! They both laugh. A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull. He stares up at the SAILORS leaning on the rail.
Speak to Diego.
Give me absolution.
I believed in you...
You are bound by an oath, Father.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them.
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
I am listening, my son.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
There'll be a time.
That's something you can't decide.
I don't want you to wait for me.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
If I ever come back, I swear I will...
Thank God...
She said yes.
... Into a monk...
... Although one may always renegotiate a contract. Especially signed by Royal Hands.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Then you are too ambitious.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
No...
We have prepared our own contract...
We have considered your -- demands very carefully, Senor Colon... Your expectations are... excessive, in every way.
You worry too much, Carvajal... The man will have to lower his demands.
No, the pheasant. It's almost raw.
It's very underdone.
Furthermore he will receive one eight of all wealth or monies, precious gems, pearls, metals, spices and other lucrative sources conquered within the boundaries of his admiralty...
He will be named Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea. Viceroy of the West Indies... Governor of all islands or lands discovered or as will be discovered with his help...
... and he demands... he DEMANDS to be made a Knight, with the right to bear the Golden Spurs! He will receive the title of Don Cristobal Colon -- which will be extended to his descendants for ever more...
You will be informed of our decision.
Thirty eight...
Forgive me... but you're the only Queen I know.
I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How little you know.
Surely you can do anything you want.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
That she was impregnable.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
It couldn't be better. Victors can't say no.
Immediately.
You wonder why I believe in you? Hey, I am a seaman. And we don't like to be told where to go, and where not to go.
I know that the Commission turned you down, right? What do you expect? You're a foreigner... But I want to help you.
Listen. I'll do the talking for both of us. You just nod. Agreed? Just as I do with the wife.
Name's Pinzon, by the way. Martin Alonzo Pinzon. I'm a ship owner from Palos...
Nothing. That's the point, Fernando.
Sssshhhh...! One can't speak to a man doing penance.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
You mustn't give way to despair.
... and therefore nothing could justify the participation of Your Highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical... if not impossible.
... can so easily be taken away.
You know, Your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so effortlessly...
Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Treasurer of Spain honors us with his presence.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Who is right? This question remains unanswered.
I am a seaman, not a scholar... But as a simple man craving for knowledge, I have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this ocean...
Excellency, you are right.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Seven weeks. Six, during the summer months.
The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations. And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed.
Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus... De Tyr believes the Ocean to be only 750 leagues...
We are.
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
I am, Your Eminence
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
I find that hard to believe.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
I haven't given you much of a life.
I know.
I could be gone for years.
They've agreed to see me in a week.
Executions. In the square.
I am happy, Father.
I'll do whatever makes you happy.
Diego.
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
Esdras is a Jew.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
By sailing West across the Ocean Sea.
... But the Turks have closed this route to all Christians. Trading with the Orient has become arduous, if not dangerous.  There is a third way...
Or by land...
By sea, sailing around the African Continent -- the journey takes a year...
To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool. MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden panel.
That's what it says.
You will be heard at the University of Salamanca...
I have something for you.
Just be careful you don't lose him.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
Yes, Father.
Diego, take Fernando to the dining hall. He must be hungry.
Once I asked my Father where he wanted to go. And he replied: "I want to travel all over the seas. I want to get behind the weather..."
... The sun set in the west on an ocean where no man had dared to venture. And beyond that, infinity... Pulling back, we discover:
There was a time when the New World didn't exist...
"And those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to purse that light in spite of others..."
Of all the words my Father wrote and there were many, I remember these the most. "Nothing that results from human progress is achieved with unanimous consent..."
Yes, Your Majesty.
He has lost control. His great arrogance has led him into depravity. He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors.
Yes, Your Honor. It is all true. All of it. I saw it with my own eyes.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the Indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the Christians.
He promised gold. Not finding the easy quantities he promised, Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute. Most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties...
Yes, Your Honor.
Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola, our first settlement in the New World, and the activities there of your servant, Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Governor of that Island. You will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us -- the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining.
Jones is my name. I'm in insurance.
I think you're right. sir. I think you've hit the nail on the head.
I said, get your hands off her. She's not a criminal. She's a doctor...a psychiatrist. RAILLY looks alarmed at that.
DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.
That's not necessary, sir. Here you go. Thanks for your cooperation. Have a good flight.
It doesn't even have an odor.
You see! Also invisible to the naked eye.
You'll have to get in line, ma'am.
Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty! But I assure you, it's not.
Here! You see? Biological! Check the papers -- it's all proper. I have a permit.
Open it?  Of course.
I'm going to have to ask you to open this, sir.
Biological samples. I have the paperwork right here.
Oh, God, we don't have time for this.
Me? Oh, yes, of course. My samples.
Maybe we can stop him. Maybe we can actually do something.
I love you, Kathryn. Remember that.
James! Thank God! I thought you'd disappeared. Listen, I think I know who it is! I saw him! It's Dr. Mason's assistant. An apocalypse nut! The next flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38. If he's there, it has to be him.
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Hey, man...
Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.  Look, I got orders, man! You know what I'm sposed to do if you don't go along? I'm sposed to shoot the lady! You got that? They said, "If Cole don't obey this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his girlfriend!"
-- flight 764 for San Francisco is now ready for boarding at Gate 36.
The phone call, man. The phone call.
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts! Here, take this.
Have a good one, sir.
Woooo-eeee. San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking! That's some trip you're taking, sir, All in one week! MR. PONYTAIL  Business.
Anything you say, chief. It's none of my business.
Leave me alone! I made a report. I didn't have to do that. RASPY VOICE  Point of fact -- you don't belong here. It's not permitted to let you stay.
It's...a long story.
Don't see a lot of this... cash.
Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
I was here...as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you...looked just like you look now.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.
It's not just my dream. I was actually here! I remember now. My parents brought me to meet my uncle. About a week or two before...before...before everybody started dying. RAILLY glances around nervously.
Airports all look the same. Maybe it's...  James! Your moustache! It's slipping.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
-- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready for boarding at Gate Seventeen.
Tell your people if they spot either one of them, not to try and apprehend then. They should notify us and...
Maybe it's going to be okay.
You can hear it on the radio all the stations...
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta the zoo last night. Then they locked up this big shot scientist in one of the cages. Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it! RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned. WOMAN CABBlE Now they got animals all over the place. Buncha zebras shut down the thruway 'bout an hour ago and some kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got traffic blocked for miles over on 22.
Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Tight? My watch says 7:30.
Might be tight.
Nine thirty
I remember you...like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.
We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
It's an expression. Here...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
I think I've seen this movie before.
Here, let me help you.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy even for you. But, just in case, I took steps to make sure you couldn't do it. I took myself out of the loop! I don't have the code any more. I don't have access to the virus. So, go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract anything of use to yourself. The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.
JEFFREY??? ... Very well. You're out of your mind, Jeffrey. I know all about your insane plan. That woman -- your psychiatrist -- she told me.
Jeffrey? I know it's you, Jeffrey. I recognize your voice.
Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.
Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.
Okay, that's Stage One. In Stage Two, Monkey Four is over here...
Oh, you know Fale! He's like, "If you
