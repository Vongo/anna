How was that?
And what about the other victims?? What about their families? He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk?
This is it? This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing?
You think this is funny?? What the hell are you laughing at?
He robbed you?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
But Chief? Over this??
End my career?
I'm abused. Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your mother was blind?
What else do you need?
What's your cut? How much?
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
What about Oleg?
You bring the cigarettes?
Where is he? Where'd he go?
Who's there?
Do you really need me?
Where's your partner?
What are you gonna do?
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Where are we going?
What are you hitting him for?
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
You got that?
Credit?
Aren't you just the cameraman?
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
What the hell are you talking about??? They're gonna do what?
What the hell happened?
Where's Daphne? Daphne?
What are you doing?
Do you have coffee?
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
Is he your boyfriend?
What's this?
Hello. How are you?
Are you alright?
Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the department and the city of New York for 10 million? Who is Zwangendaba?
Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
How was it?
Where?
Hello? Who is this?  How do I know this is you?
What are you doing here?
Robert...?
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
What do you want?
So...who's Nicky?
Nicky!?!?
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Just a shower?
Guys...give me a few minutes?
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Why won't you be angry at me for keeping my movie?
What is that?
Why not?
What is it?
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
Can you let me go?
What are you asking me?
So you were never a prostitute?
What about back home?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
So...the station is empty?
You promise?
Promise?
What're you talking about?
Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Eddie?
What are you doing? What are you saying?
Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Somewhere else?
Do you live alone?
Are you married?
Now I become custody of police department?
Don't want to film this?
Does it hurt?
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
You wanna talk to her alone?
Can I talk to you?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
A cop?
Something back home?
Why not?
Is that all there is?
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Alright?
Eddie, are you okay?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Are you hit?
Did he give you these? Was he just here?
You don't have to be afraid. We're here to protect you. Come with me. We want to talk to you. You speak English alright?
I'm a fire marshal. You remember me from the other night? You are Daphne, right?
...Daphne?
Daphne, will you be coming back to work?
I want to do it, alright?
Daphne Handlova?
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
You thirsty?
Who came by looking for her?
This her?
What are you saying?
Did you tell him you did?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you remember the man who called?
Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead?
What's wrong?
Who's there?
Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for my son?
Mind if I ride along with you?
You got any better ideas?
You goin' to the escort service?
Did you identify yourself?
What if the tip was broken off?
Our killer...our killer's standing here slashing at her. She's fightin' him. The blood is splattering this way. It's on this wall...  And there's some specks over here.  There's nothing here because someone was standing right here. Someone big. And he's got blood on him. Lots of blood. He wouldn't walk out of here like that.  Murphy, what kind of knife you think we're talking about here?
Only one guys checked in?
Any of you guys take a piss lately?
The clerk?
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Any I.D.?
Where is she?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
This all you want?
Who is he?
You're Polish?
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
Obviously they weren't having sex. As you pointed out. So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?
What would you call her?
Who says she's a suspect?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Nah, why should you?
Watch the news?
Okay to smoke?
Aren't you tired?
You hear that question, Garcia?
How long they been livin' here?
What about her cheek bones?
Look. Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good. You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her. Now why don't you pay me?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
Where is escort service?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don't meet the other girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed?
I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know her?
Where's Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move?
Permanently disrupted? Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Your doctor?
What's so funny. How does he know so much about me? Who tells him my life story?
...Yeah, and with your old man dying last year you - what's it? Just you and the dog now?
Yeah? What kind?
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
What was that, Korfin?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Who did cause and origin?
Yeah?
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
Whore?
Are you looking for companionship?
Hello?
Hi?
Worldly escorts?
Stupid, Milos. I didn't want to kill him.  What's this?
How you erase this?
Self-esteem? Self-esteem??
So you slept with your son's wife! What's that all about?
You okay?
What?
Detective...what's that you're holding in your hand? Evidence?
Is it drug related?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
How many victims are up there?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
What??
What's he looking for?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
No, what is it?
You know what that is, right?
What was that?
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
But you knew that, right?
Clean?
No, we don't mind. You mind Leon?
Mind not shining that light in my eyes?
So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried. What do you think, Eddie?
Oh yeah, why?
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
Hey, Louie, were you first due?
You couldn't listen to me, could you?
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
What are you looking for?
A job?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Did you hurt her?
What?
Any chance we can do that again?
I don't know. You always come outta your house that way?
Why you chasin' me, man?
What's your rush? Going to a party?
Okay. You ready?
Ready?
So what's unique?
Where you wanna go, buddy?
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
You ready?
When?
Will you marry me? Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday?
No. Are you proposing?
Are you married?
And what do you do with the bones?
You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
So you got your kids listening to Opera? You still singing in the church on the weekends?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Yeah?
Absomotherfuckin'lutely. You can have all three of my ex-wives. But somebody so much as looks sideways at my four girls -- I'd kill 'em.  You haven't seen my youngest have you?
My kids? Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9. Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid! How old are you? Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I right, Leon?
How old are your kids?
In love? With who?
Isn't he a little moody?
Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?
Excuse me?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
What are you coming here to do?
Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
How long are you planning to stay?
Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
No, you're travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Is there a problem?
Is he with you? Are you travelling together?
How much money are you carrying with you?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Did you hear what I said?
What does he say?
But how is he? And Dona Maria?
What are you listening to?
Can't you stay with us a little?
Oh? So you are a new man?
Have you ever forgiven me?
Will you ever forgive me?
What is...?
An ocean...? He's says it's an ocean?
What's he doing?
You know what I always used to do?
How are you feeling, Fernando?
But as least we haven't been bored, have we?
One chair. One table. What more can a man expect, when he tries to sue the Crown?
What do you see?
Then why?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Really?
Is he?
Go back?
A man! Diego, how did this happen?
Father?
How far from here?
Appointment to what?
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
You treat Christians equally with heathen savages. You execute members of the nobility. And what do you offer in return?
You know what they will say in Spain about my death -- don't you?
Do you know them?
Can you find them?
Will he survive?
What kind of disease is this?
Then let's hope not...  What will happen if we can't find enough gold?
How much gold have we found?
What is it?
Do you want her?
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
Ask the Chief what happened to my men?
Is this your new world, Don Colon?
I know. I saw them! Who did we hire today?
He is here! What is it?
Where is the Admiral? Has anyone seen the Admiral?
Are you saying you refuse to help?
What...? Do I have so many already?
May I ask by whom?
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
... for a commoner?
Do they have such thoughts?
Why?
Chief says -- how many?
No. It's enough. What would you say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon?
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Cursed?
Who gave you the order to come on board?
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You think I don't know that?
To where?
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
How do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel?
What do you read?
Now, find the North Star. Do you have it?
And what do you think Mendez?
Be good to your mother, Fernando. Do you promise?
How long?
What are you saying?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Why not?
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
No?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
A woman?
May I speak freely?
What did they say about Granada before today?
The ocean is uncrossable?
Is this a good time to meet her?
Where can I meet this man?
So. What do you say?
He can get you an audience with the Queen! You know why...? She owes him money. That's how it is. You -- me -- the Queen -- the world and his mistress -- agreed?
I don't look like it, but I have friends at the Court. The Treasurer of Aragon, for example. He finances me. His name's Santangel. Ever heard of him?
Vow of silence...? Penance?
What is it? Are you a Trappist?
Is he a spy?
Ah, thank God! I've been looking all over Seville for you! Never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh?
Senor Colon?
What can you do?
Father?
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
You would use your influence to assist this... intriguer?
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
So you consider yourself the chosen one?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Is that all that interests you?
Suppose you cross this ocean. Suppose you reach Asia. What would Spain do there?
Therefore, as a modest man, I wonder: who is right?
In your opinion, how long would the voyage be?
Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de Tyr is right...  Are we here to examine this proposal or not?
Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Are we going to argue?
Would you like to come and stay with us?
How can you be so certain?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How did you manage it?
Diego! Aren't you going to kiss your brother?
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
But there is worse. From the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the Indians, all of them reduced to slavery. When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment...  ... he was executed.  Is that not true also, Brother Buyl?
Could it be so?
From the beginning, Columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island. He appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him. He promised to build a city, the City of Isabel, named after Your Majesty. What he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. Is that not so, Brother Buyl?
Who are you calling a "moron"?
We're all in a hurry, lady. What's so special about you?
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya want?
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
I got no choice, man. These are my orders. Just take it, okay?
The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
How did you find me?
What? What for? Are you crazy?
Jo...Jose????
What? What did you say?
Why are we doing this?
Flowers! What flowers?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
What...virus?
Want the full effect?
So why should we be like him?
What's the harm in opening the bag?
And Fale believed it?
What floor are the wigs on, please?
Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?
And this.  Anything else?
You... you left them a message?
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him?
What...the...fuck..are you doing???
You want me to rob him?
Is this real -- or is this one of my delusions?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
What does this mean to you?
The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
Just like that? You were in prison?
Tommy? This is Charlie at the Globe. You know if Wallace has a new girl?
Here's ninety eight. For the night. Deal?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist? And now she's spray- painting our building?
Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights...?
Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
What's it say?
Hey! Do you know what she's doing?
You really want to know?
One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
You get the bolt cutters?
Uh, yeah, sure. Uh...who's James?
The police. I know. Listen, I need to talk to James, but he has to be careful how he contacts me. He mustn't get caught. Do you understand me?
Have you seen James Cole? The man...?
What's she doing?
So that...???
And your only goal is...???
Meaning...???
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
I'm afraid this doesn't seem very professional to me, in fact it's distressingly unprofessional for some- one who treated my son briefly  to take a sudden unsolicited interest in his mental health six years later, and to telephone a parent to express opinions that would be inappropriate...  I don't know anything about "Monkey armies", Doctor. Nothing whatsoever. If my son ever was involved in...  It would be doubly inappropriate to discuss matters of security with you, Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at ease, neither my son nor any other unauthorized person has access to any potentially dangerous organisms in this laboratory. Thank you for your concern. DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares. DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT  Dr. "Kathryn" Railly????
But you know what's real now?
So what I was thinking was, maybe if I sent a detective down there to talk with you, you could maybe revise or amplify on the circumstances.... Hello? Hello? Dr. Railly?
You found him? Is he all right?
Tell me. Tell me what I want. RASPY VOICE  To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to be topside -- breathe the air -- to be with her. ... Isn't that right? Isn't that what you want?
He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?
Did you take the sedative?
Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist -- why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were?
This the man he attacked?
I'm going to attract their attention, let them know where we are, okay?
You're sure?
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?
What made you think that?
What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
Where?
Goddamnit! Where is he?
Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" You do remember that, don't you?
Plan? What are you talking about?
I get it! This is your old plan, right?
We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs.  I am a new person! I'm completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani.  Who chattered? Goines? Weller?
You know this man?
My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Who??
They find him?
Where are you going?
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
Shot! Who shot you?
What's the matter with your leg?
What's this?
What's that mean?
What are you going to do with us?
Is this him -- Dr. Mason?
Jeffrey Mason?
Mason???
James, why don't we...?
We don't know anything about any "Army of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't you and your friend disappear, okay?
Excuse me. You looking for something in particular?
Uh, can we help you?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Is he...alive?
Are you hurt?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Clues? What kind of clues?
You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
And I was in it? What did I do?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
Do you happen to know the make of her car?
Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child? Something so bad...?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
What?
It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio? Does it play music?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me?
You sure you're gonna be all right?
You're leaving?
How'd you get here, soldier? What's your rank? Where are your clothes?
I don't understand. Where am I?
What? What??
RASPY VOICE  89! How was it? Good drugs? Lotsa pussy? Hey, Bob, you do the job? D'ju find out the "big info"?...Army of the Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was prior to mutation?
My name's not "Bob". RASPY VOICE  Not a prob, Bob. Where'd they send you?
Where are you? RASPY VOICE  You can talk! Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?
Him? You saw that man?
What about these people? Did you see any of these people?
Did you see it?
What about it, Cole?
Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
What did you do with your time, Cole?
You're certain of that?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call?
Uh, that message...me?
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
Uh, what?
Well?
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
And he was fully sedated?
He was in full restraints? And the door was locked?
You see what I mean? You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
I said it was bad judgment! What else do you want me to say?
He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it?
Eh, excuse me. Can I help you?
Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of yours, right?
Cole. James Cole -- right?
What...???
What....???
A lawsuit? You going to sue them?
Ssssst! Jose, what's going on?
You causing trouble again?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
Where you collected sample 4, what street was that?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
He's been tested for drugs?
Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
You want to go in? Examine him?
Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County?
What kind of information?
Change what?
I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
A jail? Prison?
Hiding?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
This is April, right?
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
Where are you taking me?
Jeffrey. Yo! Jeffrey. This here is James. Whyncha show James around? Tell him the TV rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?
Five thousand dollars, my man. That enough? I'll wire it to your account as usual, okay?
Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel good, we're all pals. We're prisoners, they're the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?
Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr. Railly you thought it was...  1995. ... How about right now? Do you know what year it is right now?
Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?
Can you tell us the name of the prison you've come from?
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
"From the present." We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole?
Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's the present, is that it?
These scientists, Mr. Cole? Are they doctors like ourselves?
It wasn't who you expected?
James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore?
What?
Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. It's not the right number yet. That's the problem. Damn! How can I contact them?
"What about the germs?" I say. He goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
What are you talking about???
What're you writing? You a reporter?
