Get a shot of him leaving. Then pan to me.
Cut.
No thanks.
Wait a minute. Where are you going? Learn from Eddie. Talk to the court of public opinion. Take the credit, you need it.
How was that?
A film...by Oleg Razgul.
He's still alive.
I'm not a cop. I'm a fire marshal.
I told you not to shoot! No officers should shoot.
Lower your weapon. I told you - lower your weapon!
Let her go. Let her go.
I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he lowers his gun.
Shut up!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot him!!
No on shoot! No one shoot!! No officer will follow. No officer will shoot!
Shut up!
Shoot! Shoot him!!
Let her go.
Let her go! Let her go!!
Tell him to put his gun down!
Holster your weapons! Back away. That is an order! No officers will fire!
No one shoot! Lower your weapons! Do not fire! No officer will fire his weapon unless I say so!  Let the woman go!
Let her go. Let her fucking go!!
I'll kill her! Back off! Everyone back away from me!
Drop the gun! DON'T SHOOT!
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
Traitor!!
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
He knew exactly what he was doing - all of this was planned! It's all here in my movie. Emil is not insane. Look. Look!
I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane! Hard to believe...watch!
Wait a minute, Bruce! We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at!
Be careful. I can kill you. I'm insane.
And what about the other victims?? What about their families? He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk?
You may not like it marshal, but that's the law.
This is it? This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing?
Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions.
You think this is funny?? What the hell are you laughing at?
Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!
...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future.
...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill!
Whatever's leftover, keep.
That's right, I encountered him right here. I was just askin' for change an' he whips out his big gun an' pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin' me there all exposed...
He robbed you?
Hello?  No!
Hello?  No comment.
Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct descendent of the African King from whom he takes his name...
She starts over.
Goddamn assholes everywhere. Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba. I got it. I'll do it. Shit. Let's start again.
Zwangendaba.
...and today with his partner who he blamed for the crimes still at large, Emil Slovak will appear in court. His lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial. Eyewitness News has also learned that later this month, Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing in court. He will be arraigned on charges of violating the civil rights of...Zwangen...Zwagen...
Shhhh.
Daphne, I...
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
We're gonna fight the extradition.
You want to see her - go ahead.
And just between us...I was married to a redhead. They're a jinx. Redheads are like cross-eyed priests. Stay away from both. Jordy gives him a look.
But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!
I know you got backup at home. Drop it off.
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
But Chief? Over this??
End my career?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Oh, Jesus.
Can I see your back?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your mother was blind?
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Give me another one, please.
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
What else do you need?
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
But it's...
No. No way.
I would say...half. Half is fair.
What's your cut? How much?
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
No, he is here. Shit...
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What about Oleg?
I was all of these.
...delusions and paranoia.
I want you to focus on three things: fear...
How're they treating you, alright  I want to get the cuffs off... but there's a little bit of a problem. Things out there are very negative right now for us. We gotta change that around. Perception is very, very important. Perception is reality. I know you're not fuckin' crazy. But it's important that I get that message out. Cause that's our only defense in this case.
Oh, sure.
You bring the cigarettes?
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. What's happened is not his fault. Emil was under the influence of his partner. At the trial, you'll see that my client will be vindicated...
In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims his client is unfit to stand trial.
...and the wild chase through Times Square ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping. The fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.
Shit!
Everybody down! Stay DOWN!
Look! Over here!
Shoot him! SHOOT!
Kill him! Kill the bastard!
Middle door.
Where is he? Where'd he go?
Hey, come back here!
Drop the girl! Drop her!!
Come in.
R-room service.
Who's there?
Do you really need me?
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Where's your partner?
Get down on your knees.
You'll be my first.
Pull the gun! You want to be famous? Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and make more money.
You wanna be a real American? Go for your gun.
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
What are you gonna do?
Tommy, take a walk.
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
What are you doin'? You're gonna lose everybody!
Alright, let's get going!
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Out of the way, counselor.
You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are goin' down. I'll be there with a smile when they put you down! Cutler hurries to Emil's side.
Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes. I'll follow you. Tommy, you ride with him!
He's yours but I take him in! I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Well, he killed my partner!
He's my collar!
No way! He's mine!
I'll take him.
Turn that camera off!
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
No. Keep filming...
Turn that camera off!
What are you hitting him for?
This man is unarmed, officer. He's surrendered.
I give up!
He has the camera! He took the movie!
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
Oh no! No! Shit!
Here. I have your money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil. I'm insane.
Oh, hello.
You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you.
You got that?
Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Credit?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.
Your idea? I thought it was my idea.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Die. Die.
Be quiet. Watch.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Shut up. Look!
I'm serious.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
What we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage...
You want the tape? There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
I want your shield number!
Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV, I'll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it'll come outta your mouth!
Any request for the video must be directed to "Top Story's" attorney - Bruce Cutler. I'll be happy to give you his number.
I want the tape. Go get it and bring it here this minute.
He's not on the premises!
Where is he?! Where is Hawkins?!
What the hell are you talking about??? They're gonna do what?
They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment!
What the hell happened?
Get outta here!
I did this! I did this! Take my picture! I'm Max! Max Gornick!
Where's Daphne? Daphne?
Are you alright, man? Lemme see the hand!
Jordy! What the hell happened?!
It's okay. I'm a fireman. I'm going to help you. Get back! Now!
The hallway is on fire!
Get back! Get out of the bathroom! Run!
And this is the man who started the fire. Say something to your fans, Emil!
This is great film! You can see fire right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire Marshal is here. Everything is so messy. Everything is so crazy right here! Look at this fire! We made it! 90% of people who die in fire die from eating smoke. So most likely they all die from eating smoke.
Oh shit!
Pouring it out!
What are you doing?
Oh Jesus!
Calm down. Get a hold of yourself! Get down!
They were here!
Oh my G-d! Oh my G-d!
This is Jordan Warsaw! We got a 1075, make it quick, we're trapped! 8th Avenue and 44th Street.
No! Get back! GET BACK!!!
Jordy!!!
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Do you have coffee?
Right.
You better get packed.
Let's get your stuff.
I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
Is he your boyfriend?
What's this?
Hello. How are you?
I'm sorry.
Are you alright?
The mugger.
Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the department and the city of New York for 10 million? Who is Zwangendaba?
Consider yourself served.
Yeah.
Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?
Okay. But not water sports.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Yeah.
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Not good.
How was it?
Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
Where?
Hello? Who is this?  How do I know this is you?
Trust me, you'll want to take this call. Robert steps off the stool. Takes the phone.
You've got a call.
What are you doing here?
Robert...?
Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Alright. Go ahead.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
Well, he...
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I know.
You know...you know he was gonna propose to me. The crime guys found a card he'd written out to me. And a ring box...these fuckers that killed him - have my ring. They have my diamond engagement ring... Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.
I know, son, I know. We all loved him.
I never got to tell him how much I admired him.
Awful...what an awful day. He was New York City.
Bad last moment - I cut that out.
And...action!
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action!'
Cut!
Okay. He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
Good idea!
Turn it off.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Then do it, asshole.
I kill someone famous.
What's your accomplishment.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
What do you want?
So...who's Nicky?
Nicky?!
Nicky!?!?
Coming!
I'll call you later.
It's Flemming...anything turn up? Did they check the hospitals? Airports? Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin' hit him! We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything! These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Just a shower?
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Guys...give me a few minutes?
Wait.
Eddie, I...
Will do, Chief.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
It was my decision, not his.
Oh.
This way, ma'am.
Tommy, get her outta here.
I told him to take her there.
Oh really. That's nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
No! Nothing happened.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
I let her take a shower.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Hey. Warsaw.
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Sit down!
Let me get a shot of it.
What does it look like? It's an address book!
What is that?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Why not?
I did.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What is it?
You can trust me.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I know.
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
Are you alright?
Shit!
I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.
You could shower with me.
Showers are this way.
Can you let me go?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
What are you asking me?
So you were never a prostitute?
No.
What about back home?
No.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
Yes, I considered it.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yeah. This way.
So...the station is empty?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Thank you.
See you later. Good luck.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah. I promise.
You promise?
Tonight.
Okay, til tonight.
I love you.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
I promise. We'll talk. You'll be great. You'll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Promise?
I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.
That's good.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
What? Oh. Okay. Yeah.
What're you talking about?
We need you here in twenty minutes. Get in a cab.
Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Answer it.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Eddie?
What are you doing? What are you saying?
You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet.
Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
Could be Leon's.
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
C'mere.
You're not so bad yourself.
You're ruthless.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
I'm not.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Stop it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
Hey.
Hey, honey.
She's here.
I want to talk to you about something serious.
Staring right at us.
Somewhere else?
Do you live alone?
Divorced.
Are you married?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Now I become custody of police department?
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
This is nothing.
Does it hurt?
Shut up.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.
Hey. I'm a professional.
You know what I'm saying here.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Yeah.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
Raw deal.
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Can I talk to you?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
A cop?
Yes, but he was a cop.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Something back home?
Why not?
Is that all there is?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
Go on.
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
No. I'm okay.
Are you hit?
Perfect! Cut. Print!
Emil, look!
Split up!
Put the fuckin' camera down! Let's go!
of the scene from across the corner.
Stay with her.
Did he give you these? Was he just here?
I'm a fire marshal. You remember me from the other night? You are Daphne, right?
...Daphne?
Smart girl. I'm glad you're not a whore. But washing hair? This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They should be washing your hair.
In a minute, Ludwig.
Daphne, will you be coming back to work?
I'm not a killer.
I...I have a temper.
Well, then do it after work. A customer's waiting.
I want to do it, alright?
Daphne? In the back. Probably shampooing a customer's hair.
Daphne Handlova?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Of course.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm on duty.
You thirsty?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
Describe him.
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
Who came by looking for her?
Beautiful eyes.
Yeah. Sort of. I tried to recruit her, gave her my card. She said she'd think about it but I never heard from her.
This her?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
What are you saying?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
Did you tell him you did?
No.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you remember the man who called?
Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead?
What's wrong?
C'mon in. C'mon in!
You! I've seen you on TV!
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who's there?
Better than one.
Two heads.
Oh here. A souvenir.
Heads. See, you lost twice.  Okay. Get in.
Okay. I'll call it. Heads.
I'll call it... tails. Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll let you know what happens.
Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for my son?
But what if it does? You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Mind if I ride along with you?
You got any better ideas?
You goin' to the escort service?
Good work.
Call communications and get an address on that number.
Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.
Did you identify yourself?
There was only one call from this room last night. I dialed it. It's an escort service.
I think we've already found it.
Could be. Then we should find it here somewhere.
What if the tip was broken off?
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.
Yeah.
Only one guys checked in?
Do the seat for me.
Any of you guys take a piss lately?
Clothes were off in the other room. Tub is dry except for the blood.
I'll do it.
Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room.
The clerk?
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
After you.
Tommy Cullen. Heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you. Here's what we got. A girl in there, figure her to be a prostitute, looks like she was fighting for her life. She's got defense wounds on her hands. Right this way - in the bathroom.
It's okay.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case. Jordy enters. Leon steps in his way.
Any I.D.?
Takin' a bath.
Where is she?
Thank you, son.
Let me help.
Get a taxi.
And these.
Yes. Both.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
In here, says he wants a million.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
This all you want?
New York's finest. This is his case.
Who is he?
This is second day in America. First day was very exciting. Full of thrills and chills. Over there, is co-star of my new movie, Emil!
Stay here.
My folks are.
You're Polish?
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
I'll come with you.
Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh. Really? Okay.  We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue. A stabbing. Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian...
Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?
What would you call her?
Who says she's a suspect?
Hmmmm.
Pretty.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Good. Good. Commendable.
Nah, why should you?
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Watch the news?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Okay to smoke?
She keepin' you up? Like to meet her, huh? She'd make you forget your ex wife. Cure your insomnia.
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
I got the owner of the plumbing company Milos worked for.
Well, they're definitely permanent residents now.
Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone - they've been here illegally.
You hear that question, Garcia?
How long they been livin' here?
I gotta good look at her.
Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge. Big, blue eyes and when I saw her, she looked scared. Like she was looking to get away. But she was absolutely beautiful.
What about her cheek bones?
Give me the address!!
I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
Where is escort service?
I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know her?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Where's Czech girl?
Hi, I'm Honey.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Get in the bathroom!
I love America. No one is responsible for what they do.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move?
Look, I'm a victim here, too. I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate. My life has been permanently disrupted.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Your doctor?
Louder.
Louder.
Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now, Mr. Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim. According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to believe...watch.
Okay. Okay. We'll ban him from the station.
He's no joke! One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big.
He hangs around downstairs. The guys talk to him. He's a joke...
What's so funny. How does he know so much about me? Who tells him my life story?
Get in line.
That's it. I'm suing.
That's it! You're outta here.
Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a big shot downtown.
Max!
...Yeah, and with your old man dying last year you - what's it? Just you and the dog now?
Max.
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Yeah? What kind?
I used an accelerant.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
It's my fire! Screw homicide. I'll tell you guys everything!
Hey guys, I got your torch. He just gave a full confession.
You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah, right.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Who did cause and origin?
What the hell is that?? You gave Eddie Flemming the evidence?!
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Yeah?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
I take her. Send her!
Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech girl.
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
Whore?
Are you looking for companionship?
Hello?
Hi?
Worldly escorts?
How you erase this?
You said speak Czech!
Speak English!
Turn that fucking thing off!
Losin' my job and everything, caused my behavioral disorder.  Forgive me, Kirk. Let me hug you? The audience boos. Roseanne mediates...
Self-esteem? Self-esteem??
I take full responsibility for sleepin' with my daughter in law. I had low self esteem, I thought I had to compete with him.
So you slept with your son's wife! What's that all about?
Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this. Now get outta here.
A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights!
You okay?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
You motherfuckin' bastard! She stripped me! It was a bag lady! She touched me all over, it was disgusting.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no!
What?
Detective...what's that you're holding in your hand? Evidence?
Is it drug related?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
There are two bodies found at this point.
How many victims are up there?
Detective, does it look like a murder?
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
What??
He knew all along.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
Here you go. A big double homicide.
A timer.
What's he looking for?
No problem.
No, what is it?
You know what that is, right?
Evidence. Of a homicide.
What was that?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.
That's what it looks like to me.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
But you knew that, right?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
Clean?
Mouth's clean, too.
Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
No. Go ahead.
Sorry, bro.
Mind not shining that light in my eyes?
Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe. Looks like they got careless.
Oh, sure.
Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents.
Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried. What do you think, Eddie?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Oh yeah, why?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
Yo, Jordy!
Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.
Hey, Louie, were you first due?
Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor.
Wait! Come back!!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Nice - how many people you ripped off tonight?! Get up!
Oh yeah? Guess again.
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.
What are you looking for?
Six month visa. Still here two years later. They'll deport her if she goes to Police.
Daphne Hanlova.
She saw!
We started over, you can too.
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
It's easy to learn.
As a plumber?!
Yes, the money is good.
A job?
I can get you a job.
Emil. I'll help you.
Emil. Put down the knife.
Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Ha. Ha.
We spent it!
Milos. Get my money!
Hello, Tamina.
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Did you hurt her?
Surprise! Surprise!
Emil???!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
What?
There. 5RW.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
Any chance we can do that again?
I know you man.
Well, sounds like burglary to me.
Why you chasin' me, man?
What's your rush? Going to a party?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Okay. You ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Ready?
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
Yeah. I make big cases, they make the news and I look good. But the problem with becoming a star is downtown. They shoot at stars. Now be quiet. Shhh.
Top floor. Back room.
Yeah. And he still went to the party. Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.
That's unique.
He's from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Not what. Who.
So what's unique?
Go!
Here.
Where you wanna go, buddy?
We have no money. Come on.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
The thrill of the hunt. I love it.
You ready?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
When?
I'm gonna propose.
Will you marry me? Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday?
No. Are you proposing?
Are you married?
Dog food.
And what do you do with the bones?
You stuff sausage in it.
You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
I am butcher.
Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
So you got your kids listening to Opera? You still singing in the church on the weekends?
Step into my office.
Paulie, I need the cure.
Sure it's him? Great!  Unique's home.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Yeah?
How old are your kids?
In love? With who?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
I'm not moody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
Vodka tonic.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Another martini.
Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?
Jesus Christ.
Look how long the line is. We gotta move 'em out. I'll take them down to secondary.
He made joke, bad joke. First time on airplane...
Excuse me?
Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
I'm here for movies.
What are you coming here to do?
A cheap hotel.
Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
New York.
Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
I speak English.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Two weeks.
How long are you planning to stay?
We are both from Prague.
Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
Yes...he's my friend.
No, you're travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Is there a problem?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Yes.
Is he with you? Are you travelling together?
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
I have five-hundred dollars.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks holiday.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Yes sir.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
I want to document my trip to America.
Did you hear what I said?
Okay.
Okay.
I remember...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
What does he say?
This one is from Mendez!
Fine, it seems. Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo... He says he received many letters for you. Some of your men, mostly.
But how is he? And Dona Maria?
It's Diego... He is at the Court, with Santangel... He says they hope to get your privileges restored... And maybe the house.
What are you listening to?
What is it, now? Tell me...
I am busy inside.
God bless you, and those like you!
Oh? So you are a new man?
New worlds create new people.
I knew you would.
I have to disagree.
More than ever I wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens... The world changes -- and yet it seems the same. We find new worlds, but fill them with the same people...
Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens.
Have you ever forgiven me?
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I suppose we're both old men now.
A waste...? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You can see for yourself.
My God...! I thought he was dead.
His name... Amerigo Vespucci...
... This continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your Majesty...
Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace -- has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent... Tierra Incognita...
... West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo. From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael... Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios...
The sunset route to the new
Captain Mendez!
Will you ever forgive me?
Your brother was right. I should have never taken you with me. I'll never forgive myself. Never!
I... I have to see Mendez.
Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de Dios...  But as he vomits and cries, he notices:
What is...?
Oh my God...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Father...
Here is Europe... and over here, the continent of Asia. But there's something in between! Another continent! We've found... another continent!
An ocean...? He's says it's an ocean?
No. Says those are lakes. Water on other side big -- as wide as here.
Ask him if he means a lake. A big lake.
He says -- water on the other side.
Tell me what he's saying.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
What's he doing?
The mainland...
Tierra...! Tierra!
Swallow a piece of pork fat on a string. It always worked.
You know what I always used to do?
Not bad.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Steady as she goes...
West... southwest, Captain Mendez...
I wish you could have compromised. It would have made your life easier...
On the contrary. It is I who owe you everything. Through you, I have been an adventurer, an explorer! It's true I shall never see the new world... but it's here...  And here...
I owe you everything, Santangel...
One chair. One table. What more can a man expect, when he tries to sue the Crown?
God, how much I've missed you!
They took everything...
All of them created by people like me.
Roofs... towers, palaces...
What do you see?
Look out of that window.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Call them.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Because he is not afraid of me.
Then why?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Thank you.
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world...
Now I do look older than you.
Rise... Please...
Really?
Is he?
Penitent...? He is suing us for breach of contract!
In a way, it does, Don Sanchez.  I beg Your Majesty to receive him. To hear him... He will make no more demands. He has changed. He is penitent.
It does not belong to him.
All he asks is a chance to explore this... mainland.
Granted his faults. Yes, a hundred times! But the man is still remarkable.
I am happy for you, Diego.
She's very beautiful! The Queen has very good taste. Diego is getting married.
Nobody is forcing you to come with us.
In your present state it is madness, Father!
This time with me!
I have to explore the mainland.
Go back?
Good! I have to go back!
Santangel is going to see the Queen.
A man! Diego, how did this happen?
Fernando...! My God...! He laughs, overcome with joy. Embraces DIEGO.
Father?
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
How far from here?
Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency.
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Appointment to what?
My letters of appointment.
Yes... I remember...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
He must be replaced.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty. It is all true. I saw it with my own eyes.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
You never learned how to speak my language.
Utapan!
This is not how I imagined it to be.
Perhaps hope only exists in the journey. When it begins, everything is still possible -- every expectation; every dream...
Nobody wants one...! Only you!
A new world, Brother Buyl.
You treat Christians equally with heathen savages. You execute members of the nobility. And what do you offer in return?
You may do as you please, Brother Buyl -- though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly.
I wish to go back with them, Don Colon. I have no desire to remain in this godless place.
You are nothing! You bastards will never inherit your titles. We are everything. We are immortal!
Do you know them?
We have to stop this war.
You did the same to your God!
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
Can you find them?
You will regret this.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Tell them I want them to watch this!
Tell him to put his hands on the table. Like this!
Bring him here!
He's lying!
He says he has not found any!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
No, Your Majesty. They go mad -- then they die. There is nothing we can do.
Will he survive?
It seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women, Your Majesty.
God forgive us!
What kind of disease is this?
Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.
Not enough to justify a single shipment.
How much gold have we found?
We've got to learn to live like the Indians.  Eat your Iguana!
Nothing grows here! Everything rots in the ground. The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them.
He wishes he were back in the seminary. Priests always eat well.  And they have very good cellars.
I'm not an Indian.
What wrong with it? The Indians eat it!
Iguana.
I'd like to know what I'm eating.
Eat! I'll tell you later.
What is it?
She's more than that!
Nima's a good cook!
To the new world, my friend! To the new world!
